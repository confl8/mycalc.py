Prompt for first number 
Read first number and store in variable 
Display operations (1-add, 2-subtract, 3-multiply, 4-divide) 
Prompt for operation 
Read operation and store in variable 
Prompt for second number 
Read second number and store in variable 
If operation is equal to 1 (add) 
   Then 
       Add first number to second number and store result in variable 
Otherwise if operation is equal to 2 (subtract) 
   Then 
       Subtract second number from first number and store result in a variable
Otherwise if operation is equal to 3 (multiply) 
   Then 
      Multiply first number with second number and store result in a variable Other wise if operation is equal to 4 (divide) 
   Then 
      Divide first number by the second number and store result in a variable 
Otherwise exit program 
   Display the result stored in the variable 
Exit the program
